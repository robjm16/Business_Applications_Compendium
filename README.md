## Applying AI to Business: A Guide to Information Sources

There is growing consensus, backed by recent surveys, that the biggest challenges in applying AI to business have little to do with the algorithmic technologies themselves.  They have proven to be extremely powerful and adaptable.

Rather, implementation challenges are far more likely related to data issues and an array of organizational, ethical and other considerations.  These include: 

-	 Data quality, missing data and difficulty integrating data housed across disparate systems.  
-	 Project risks, including those related to cybersecurity (e.g., hacking, "adverserial" photos that fool image-recognition systems), data privacy and model bias (e.g., credit risk algorithms that unwittingly penalize certain groups).  
-	 Difficulties recruiting data scientists and other technical experts, and questions about how to organize and manage them (e.g., in centers of excellence or within lines of business).   
-  How to get started: type and scope of pilot projects. 
-  Who leads potentially large-scale AI change efforts, and how.
-	 How, when and where to involve line-of-business leaders and other domain experts in AI projects.    
-  Measuring results, including ROI (return on investment) and KPIs (key performance indicators).   
-  A host of change management issues, ranging from new job roles to reworked business processes. 
-  Operationalizing AI models - how they are deployed, maintained and fine-tuned over time.
-  Communications around much of the above, including how to explain complex or opaque AI models to gain stakeholder acceptance.

In short, as with other transformative technologies, companies are finding that people and process challenges can easily surpass the technical ones. 

To help you navigate AI implementation, below is a compendium of articles, research reports and other resources focused on the application of AI to the business world.  

(Note that the term AI is used here in its broadest sense.  It refers to any computer technique – including if/then-type computer logic, machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression models and decision trees) and neural networks – that aims to mimic human intelligence.)

The information sources below are broken down first by key AI repositories, followed by a list of ad hoc articles and reports.  The key repositories are a good starting point for gaining understanding of AI adoption issues.  You can stay abreast of new developments by subscribing to their updates or following them on Twitter. 

Lastly, to help you start thinking about possible AI uses in your company, a table with sample use cases, broken down by function (e.g., marketing, HR) and by industry, is at the bottom of this article.

Looks at organizational, people and data issues slowing down AI adoption, especially at companies not expressly built around data capture and usage.  "If companies don’t stop and build connections between[disparate] systems, then machine learning will work on just some of their data. That explains why the most common uses of AI so far have involved business processes that are siloed but nonetheless have abundant data, such as computer security or fraud detection at banks."

"Respondents clearly say that technology isn’t the problem—people and (to a lesser extent) processes are.… Yet we would guess with high confidence that the great majority of spending on big data and AI goes for technology and its development. We hear little about initiatives devoted to changing human attitudes and behaviors around data. " Among factors working against successful adoption are: lack of organizational alignment/agility (cited as top factor by 40%), cultural resistance (24%), understanding of data as an asset (14%) and executive leadership (7%).  Only 5% cite technology as the top challenge. 
- [AI Adoption in the Enterprise](https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp) (February 2019) from O'Reilly Media. Another large survey, covering AI-related budgets, technology use and implementation obstacles.  Interesting points: 17% of respondents cite difficulty identifying use cases as a bottleneck; companies are most apt to apply AI in functions with existing analytic functions already in place, such as IT and finance.

"The real value of data science lies not in making existing processes incrementally more efficient but rather in the creation of new algorithmic capabilities that enable step-function changes in value....[T]wo things—low cost exploration and empirical evidence—set data science apart from other business functions."

The Chief Algorithms Officer at online personalized retailer Stitch Fix argues that data scientist generalists are better at innovation than teams of specialists (e.g., algorithm experts, data engineers), under most circumstances.  That's because uncovering new business value is fundamentally different than assembly line-type activities.   The effort and down-time costs of personal coordination between specialists is at odds with quick trial-and-error iteration.

"A massive skills and language gap has emerged between key organizational decision makers and their 'AI teams.' It is a barrier that promises to stall, delay, or sink algorithmic innovations. And it is growing, not shrinking."
