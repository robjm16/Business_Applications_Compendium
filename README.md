## Applying AI to Business: A Guide to Information Sources

There is growing consensus, backed by recent surveys, that the biggest challenges in applying AI to business have little to do with the algorithmic technologies themselves. They are customizable, robust and effective, with some out-of-the-box AI capabilities already embedded in popular CRM and ERP systems.

Rather, implementation challenges are far more likely tied to data issues and an array of organizational considerations.  These include: 

  •	Data quality, missing data and difficulty integrating data housed in disparate systems.  
  •	Risks including cybersecurity (e.g., hacking, fooling face-recognition systems), data privacy concerns, and the potential for unwittingly introducing biased models (e.g., credit risk algorithms that unfairly penalize certain groups).  
  •	Difficulties recruiting data scientists and other AI experts, and questions around how to organize and manage them (e.g., in centers of excellence or within lines of business). 
  •	Getting started: type and scope of pilot projects.
  •	How to use line-of-business leaders and other subject matter experts in AI projects.  
  • Measuring results, either in terms of ROI (return on investment) or KPIs (key performance indicators). 
  •	A host of change management issues, including new roles for people to entirely new business processes.  

As with other transformative technologies, businesses are finding that people and process challenges can easily surpass the technical ones. 

To help you navigate AI implementation, below is a compendium of articles, research reports and other resources focused on the application of AI to the business world.  

Note that the term AI is used here in its broadest sense.  It refers to any computer technique – including if/then computer logic, machine learning algorithms (such as regression models and decision trees) and advanced neural networks – that aims to mimic human intelligence.

The information sources below are broken down first by key AI repositories, followed by a llist of ad hoc articles and reports.  The key repositories are a good starting point for gaining understanding of AI adoption issues.  You can stay abreast of new developments by signing up for updates from these sources.

Looks at organizational, people and data issues slowing down AI adoption, especially at companies not expressly built around data capture and usage.  "If companies don’t stop and build connections between[disparate] systems, then machine learning will work on just some of their data. That explains why the most common uses of AI so far have involved business processes that are siloed but nonetheless have abundant data, such as computer security or fraud detection at banks."

"Respondents clearly say that technology isn’t the problem—people and (to a lesser extent) processes are.… Yet we would guess with high confidence that the great majority of spending on big data and AI goes for technology and its development. We hear little about initiatives devoted to changing human attitudes and behaviors around data. " Among factors working against successful adoption are: lack of organizational alignment/agility (cited as top factor by 40%), cultural resistance (24%), understanding of data as an asset (14%) and executive leadership (7%).  Only 5% cite technology as the top challenge.
