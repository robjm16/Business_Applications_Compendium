## The Business of Data Science
_A compendium of articles, research reports and other resources focused on the application of data science (including artificial intelligence) to the business world._

_A good starting point is the comprehensive repositories of AI-related information hosted by McKinsey, the large consulting firm, and The Wall Street Journal.  They are covered below, followed by other information sources_


#### McKinsey
Brings considerable research and analysis under an [Analytics Insights](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights) landing page on its website. 

An [interactive tool](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/visualizing-the-uses-and-potential-impact-of-ai-and-other-analytics) lets you explore 400 business use cases, covering 19 industries and nine business functions.  The tool also let's you see the most likely data science techniques (e.g., regression, neural network) for each business objective.

Looks at organizational, people and data issues slowing down AI adoption, especially at companies not expressly built around data capture and usage.  "If companies don’t stop and build connections between[disparate] systems, then machine learning will work on just some of their data. That explains why the most common uses of AI so far have involved business processes that are siloed but nonetheless have abundant data, such as computer security or fraud detection at banks."

[T]wo things—low cost exploration and empirical evidence—set data science apart from other business functions."

- [Big Data and AI Executive Survey 2019](http://newvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Big-Data-Executive-Survey-2019-Findings-Updated-010219-1.pdf?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Data_Elixir_220) by NewVantage Partners, a consulting firm, finds lots of corporate enthusiasm for AI, but mixed results in implementing.  " Respondents clearly say that technology isn’t the problem—people and (to a lesser extent) processes are.… Yet we would guess with high confidence that the great majority of spending on big data and AI goes for technology and its development. We hear little about initiatives devoted to changing human attitudes and behaviors around data. " Among factors working against successful adoption are: lack of organizational alignment/agility (cited as top factor by 40%), cultural resistance (24%), understanding of data as an asset (14%) and executive leadership (7%).  Only 5% cite technology as the top challenge.
