## Applying AI to Business: A Guide to Information Sources

There is growing consensus, backed by recent surveys, that the biggest challenges in applying AI to business have little to do with the algorithmic technologies themselves. They are robust, customizable and increasingly effective, with some out-of-the-box AI capabilities already embedded in popular CRM and ERP systems.

Rather, implementation challenges are far more likely related to data issues and an array of organizational considerations.  These include: 

-	 Data quality, missing data and difficulty integrating data housed across disparate systems.  
-	 Risks, including cybersecurity (e.g., hacking, fooling face-recognition systems), data privacy and model bias (e.g., credit risk algorithms that unwittingly penalize certain groups).  
-	 Difficulties recruiting data scientists and other AI experts, and questions about how to organize and manage them (e.g., in centers of excellence or within lines of business).   
-  How to get started: type and scope of pilot projects.  
-	 How, when and where to use line-of-business leaders and other domain experts in AI projects.    
-  Measuring results, including ROI (return on investment) and KPIs (key performance indicators).   
-  A host of change management issues, ranging from new job roles to new business processes.  

As with other transformative technologies, companies are finding that people and process challenges can easily surpass the technical ones. 

To help you navigate AI implementation, below is a compendium of articles, research reports and other resources focused on the application of AI to the business world.  

(Note that the term AI is used here in its broadest sense.  It refers to any computer technique – including if/then-type computer logic, machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression models and decision trees) and advanced neural networks – that aims to mimic human intelligence.)

The information sources below are broken down first by key AI repositories, followed by a list of ad hoc articles and reports.  The key repositories are a good starting point for gaining understanding of AI adoption issues.  You can stay abreast of new developments by subscribing to their updates or following them on Twitter.

Looks at organizational, people and data issues slowing down AI adoption, especially at companies not expressly built around data capture and usage.  "If companies don’t stop and build connections between[disparate] systems, then machine learning will work on just some of their data. That explains why the most common uses of AI so far have involved business processes that are siloed but nonetheless have abundant data, such as computer security or fraud detection at banks."

"Respondents clearly say that technology isn’t the problem—people and (to a lesser extent) processes are.… Yet we would guess with high confidence that the great majority of spending on big data and AI goes for technology and its development. We hear little about initiatives devoted to changing human attitudes and behaviors around data. " Among factors working against successful adoption are: lack of organizational alignment/agility (cited as top factor by 40%), cultural resistance (24%), understanding of data as an asset (14%) and executive leadership (7%).  Only 5% cite technology as the top challenge.
